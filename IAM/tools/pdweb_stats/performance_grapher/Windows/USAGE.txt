This is the usage information for the performance graphing tool.
There are three ways to use the tool: using the static driver, the individual batch files,
and the multiple graph driver. Whichever method is used, the commands must be run from the
directory where the drivers are located.

To use the static driver, all of the log files must be renamed stat.log (e.g. the pdweb.authn log
must be named authn.log vhj_1.log). All of these log files must be put into the logs folder in the directory
where the tool resides. If these guidelines are followed, then just run static_graph_driver.bat and it will
graph every available log file, putting the output into the current_output_graphs directory. The
downside of this option is that you cannot name the output folder and all of the log files must be
named correctly.

In summary, put log files -> rename the log files -> run perl_driver.bat -> output graphs in
		into logs folder				            current_output_graphs

To use the individual .bat files like plot_authn.bat, put the input log file as the first argument
